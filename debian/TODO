* Get bos restrict working.

* The configuration transcript and the README.servers file would be best
  read together, but preferrably with some nicer formatting (such as HTML
  with a style sheet to set off the transcript in a different background
  color).

* The way the module packages are generated could stand to be simplified
  considerably.  Much of what prep-modules does is not actually necessary
  and just makes the script hard to read.  Also, rethink whether both
  control.module and control.module-image are needed, and try to use
  substvars to handle the control.module variables rather than dynamically
  generating the control file.

* Include some of the other random useful AFS programs in openafs-client
  (scout, vlclient, fstrace, up).

* Consider including the kdump executable in the kernel module package.
