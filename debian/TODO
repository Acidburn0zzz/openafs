* Get bos restrict working.

* The configuration transcript and the README.servers file would be best
  read together, but preferrably with some nicer formatting (such as HTML
  with a style sheet to set off the transcript in a different background
  color).

* Include some of the other random useful AFS programs in openafs-client
  (scout, vlclient, fstrace, up).

* Consider including the kdump executable in the kernel module package.
