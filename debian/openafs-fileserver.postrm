# Purges various extra configuration files and data files created by the
# package.  Whether to purge KeyFile is a bit iffy since the user created it
# with asetkey or with bos addkey, but it always exists for any running server
# and we shouldn't be losing any critical data.
#
# We intentionally don't remove NetInfo and NetRestrict in
# /var/lib/openafs/local since those are created separately by the user and
# may contain information not stored elsewhere.
