Subject: Collected Debian patches for OpenAFS
Author: Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>

The packaging for OpenAFS is maintained in Git with no Debian-specific
patches, just cherry-picks from upstream (possibly from upstream Gerrit).
This makes it complex to separate the changes into individual patches.
They are therefore all included in a single Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.
