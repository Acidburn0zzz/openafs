.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfileserver\fR command initializes the File Server component of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`fs\*(C'\fR process. In the conventional configuration, its binary file is
located in the \fI/usr/afs/bin\fR directory on a file server machine.
.PP
The \fBfileserver\fR command is not normally issued at the command shell
prompt, but rather placed into a database server machine's
\&\fI/usr/afs/local/BosConfig\fR file with the \fBbos create\fR command. If it is
ever issued at the command shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a
file server machine as the local superuser \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The File Server creates the \fI/usr/afs/logs/FileLog\fR log file as it
initializes, if the file does not already exist. It does not write a
detailed trace by default, but use the \fB\-d\fR option to increase the amount
of detail. Use the \fBbos getlog\fR command to display the contents of the
log file.
.PP
The command's arguments enable the administrator to control many aspects
of the File Server's performance, as detailed in \s-1OPTIONS\s0.  By default
the \fBfileserver\fR command sets values for many arguments that are suitable
for a medium-sized file server machine. To set values suitable for a small
or large file server machine, use the \fB\-S\fR or \fB\-L\fR flag
respectively. The following list describes the parameters and
corresponding argument for which the \fBfileserver\fR command sets default
values, and the table below summarizes the setting for each of the three
machine sizes.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum number of lightweight processes (LWPs) the File Server uses to
handle requests for data; corresponds to the \fB\-p\fR argument. The File
Server always uses a minimum of 32 \s-1KB\s0 for these processes.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum number of directory blocks the File Server caches in memory;
corresponds to the \fB\-b\fR argument. Each cached directory block (buffer)
consumes 2,092 bytes of memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum number of large vnodes the File Server caches in memory for
tracking directory elements; corresponds to the \fB\-l\fR argument. Each large
vnode consumes 292 bytes of memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum number of small vnodes the File Server caches in memory for
tracking file elements; corresponds to the \fB\-s\fR argument.  Each small
vnode consumes 100 bytes of memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum volume cache size, which determines how many volumes the File
Server can cache in memory before having to retrieve data from disk;
corresponds to the \fB\-vc\fR argument.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum number of callback structures the File Server caches in
memory; corresponds to the \fB\-cb\fR argument. Each callback structure
consumes 16 bytes of memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum number of Rx packets the File Server uses; corresponds to the
\&\fB\-rxpck\fR argument. Each packet consumes 1544 bytes of memory.
.PP
The default values are:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
To override any of the values, provide the indicated argument (which can
be combined with the \fB\-S\fR or \fB\-L\fR flag).
.PP
The amount of memory required for the File Server varies. The approximate
default memory usage is 751 \s-1KB\s0 when the \fB\-S\fR flag is used (small
configuration), 1.1 \s-1MB\s0 when all defaults are used (medium configuration),
and 1.4 \s-1MB\s0 when the \fB\-L\fR flag is used (large configuration). If
additional memory is available, increasing the value of the \fB\-cb\fR and
\&\fB\-vc\fR arguments can improve File Server performance most directly.
.PP
By default, the File Server allows a volume to exceed its quota by 1 \s-1MB\s0
when an application is writing data to an existing file in a volume that
is full. The File Server still does not allow users to create new files in
a full volume. To change the default, use one of the following arguments:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Set the \fB\-spare\fR argument to the number of extra kilobytes that the File
Server allows as overage. A value of \f(CW0\fR allows no overage.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Set the \fB\-pctspare\fR argument to the percentage of the volume's quota the
File Server allows as overage.
.PP
By default, the File Server implicitly grants the \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR (administer) and
\&\f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup) permissions to system:administrators on the access control
list (\s-1ACL\s0) of every directory in the volumes stored on its file server
machine. In other words, the group's members can exercise those two
permissions even when an entry for the group does not appear on an \s-1ACL\s0. To
change the set of default permissions, use the \fB\-implicit\fR argument.
.PP
The File Server maintains a \fIhost current protection subgroup\fR (\fIhost
\&\s-1CPS\s0\fR) for each client machine from which it has received a data access
request. Like the \s-1CPS\s0 for a user, a host \s-1CPS\s0 lists all of the Protection
Database groups to which the machine belongs, and the File Server compares
the host \s-1CPS\s0 to a directory's \s-1ACL\s0 to determine in what manner users on the
machine are authorized to access the directory's contents. When the \fBpts
adduser\fR or \fBpts removeuser\fR command is used to change the groups to
which a machine belongs, the File Server must recompute the machine's host
\&\s-1CPS\s0 in order to notice the change. By default, the File Server contacts
the Protection Server every two hours to recompute host CPSs, implying
that it can take that long for changed group memberships to become
effective. To change this frequency, use the \fB\-hr\fR argument.
.PP
The File Server generates the following message when a partition is nearly
full:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   No space left on device
.Ve
.PP
This command does not use the syntax conventions of the \s-1AFS\s0 command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
Do not use the \fB\-k\fR and \-w arguments, which are intended for use by the
\&\s-1AFS\s0 Development group only. Changing them from their default values can
result in unpredictable File Server behavior.  In any case, on many
operating systems the File Server uses native threads rather than the \s-1LWP\s0
threads, so using the \fB\-k\fR argument to set the number of \s-1LWP\s0 threads has
no effect.
.PP
Do not specify both the \fB\-spare\fR and \fB\-pctspare\fR arguments. Doing so
causes the File Server to exit, leaving an error message in the
\&\fI/usr/afs/logs/FileLog\fR file.
.PP
Options that are available only on some system types, such as the \fB\-m\fR
and \fB\-lock\fR options, appear in the output generated by the \fB\-help\fR
option only on the relevant system type.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-d\fR <\fIdebug level\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-d <debug level>"
Sets the detail level for the debugging trace written to the
\&\fI/usr/afs/logs/FileLog\fR file. Provide one of the following values, each
of which produces an increasingly detailed trace: \f(CW0\fR, \f(CW1\fR, \f(CW5\fR, \f(CW25\fR,
and \f(CW125\fR. The default value of \f(CW0\fR produces only a few messages.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR <\fInumber of processes\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-p <number of processes>"
Sets the number of threads to run. Provide a positive integer. The File
Server creates and uses five threads for special purposes, in addition to
the number specified (but if this argument specifies the maximum possible
number, the File Server automatically uses five of the threads for its own
purposes).
.Sp
The maximum number of threads can differ in each release of \s-1AFS\s0.  Consult
the \fI\s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AFS\s0 Release Notes\fR for the current release.
.IP "\fB\-spare\fR <\fInumber of spare blocks\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-spare <number of spare blocks>"
Specifies the number of additional kilobytes an application can store in a
volume after the quota is exceeded. Provide a positive integer; a value of
\&\f(CW0\fR prevents the volume from ever exceeding its quota. Do not combine
this argument with the \fB\-pctspare\fR argument.
.IP "\fB\-pctspare\fR <\fIpercentage spare\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-pctspare <percentage spare>"
Specifies the amount by which the File Server allows a volume to exceed
its quota, as a percentage of the quota. Provide an integer between \f(CW0\fR
and \f(CW99\fR. A value of \f(CW0\fR prevents the volume from ever exceeding its
quota. Do not combine this argument with the \fB\-spare\fR argument.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR <\fIbuffers\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-b <buffers>"
Sets the number of directory buffers. Provide a positive integer.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR <\fIlarge vnodes\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-l <large vnodes>"
Sets the number of large vnodes available in memory for caching directory
elements. Provide a positive integer.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR <\fIsmall nodes\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-s <small nodes>"
Sets the number of small vnodes available in memory for caching file
elements. Provide a positive integer.
.IP "\fB\-vc\fR <\fIvolume cachesize\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-vc <volume cachesize>"
Sets the number of volumes the File Server can cache in memory.  Provide a
positive integer.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR <\fIcall back wait interval\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-w <call back wait interval>"
Sets the interval at which the daemon spawned by the File Server performs
its maintenance tasks. Do not use this argument; changing the default
value can cause unpredictable behavior.
.IP "\fB\-cb\fR <\fInumber of callbacks\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cb <number of callbacks>"
Sets the number of callbacks the File Server can track. Provide a positive
integer.
.IP "\fB\-banner\fR" 4
.IX Item "-banner"
Prints the following banner to \fI/dev/console\fR about every 10 minutes.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   File Server is running at I<time>.
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-novbc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-novbc"
Prevents the File Server from breaking the callbacks that Cache Managers
hold on a volume that the File Server is reattaching after the volume was
offline (as a result of the \fBvos restore\fR command, for example). Use of
this flag is strongly discouraged.
.IP "\fB\-implicit\fR <\fIadmin mode bits\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-implicit <admin mode bits>"
Defines the set of permissions granted by default to the
system:administrators group on the \s-1ACL\s0 of every directory in a volume
stored on the file server machine. Provide one or more of the standard
permission letters (\f(CW\*(C`rlidwka\*(C'\fR) and auxiliary permission letters
(\f(CW\*(C`ABCDEFGH\*(C'\fR), or one of the shorthand notations for groups of permissions
(\f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR). To review the meaning of the
permissions, see the \fBfs setacl\fR reference page.
.IP "\fB\-hr\fR <\fInumber of hours between refreshing the host cps\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-hr <number of hours between refreshing the host cps>"
Specifies how often the File Server refreshes its knowledge of the
machines that belong to protection groups (refreshes the host CPSs for
machines). The File Server must update this information to enable users
from machines recently added to protection groups to access data for which
those machines now have the necessary \s-1ACL\s0 permissions.
.IP "\fB\-busyat\fR <\fIredirect clients when queue > n\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-busyat <redirect clients when queue > n>"
Defines the number of incoming RPCs that can be waiting for a response
from the File Server before the File Server returns the error code
\&\f(CW\*(C`VBUSY\*(C'\fR to the Cache Manager that sent the latest \s-1RPC\s0. In response, the
Cache Manager retransmits the \s-1RPC\s0 after a delay. This argument prevents
the accumulation of so many waiting RPCs that the File Server can never
process them all. Provide a positive integer.  The default value is
\&\f(CW600\fR.
.IP "\fB\-rxpck\fR <\fInumber of rx extra packets\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-rxpck <number of rx extra packets>"
Controls the number of Rx packets the File Server uses to store data for
incoming RPCs that it is currently handling, that are waiting for a
response, and for replies that are not yet complete. Provide a positive
integer.
.IP "\fB\-rxdbg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rxdbg"
Writes a trace of the File Server's operations on Rx packets to the file
\&\fI/usr/afs/logs/rx_dbg\fR.
.IP "\fI\-rxdbge\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rxdbge"
Writes a trace of the File Server's operations on Rx events (such as
retransmissions) to the file \fI/usr/afs/logs/rx_dbg\fR.
.IP "\fI\-m\fR <\fImin percentage spare in partition\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-m <min percentage spare in partition>"
Specifies the percentage of each \s-1AFS\s0 server partition that the \s-1AIX\s0 version
of the File Server creates as a reserve. Specify an integer value between
\&\f(CW0\fR and \f(CW30\fR; the default is 8%. A value of \f(CW0\fR means that the
partition can become completely full, which can have serious negative
consequences.
.IP "\fB\-lock\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lock"
Prevents any portion of the fileserver binary from being paged (swapped)
out of memory on a file server machine running the \s-1IRIX\s0 operating system.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L"
Sets values for many arguments in a manner suitable for a large file
server machine. Combine this flag with any option except the \fB\-S\fR flag;
omit both flags to set values suitable for a medium-sized file server
machine.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Sets values for many arguments in a manner suitable for a small file
server machine. Combine this flag with any option except the \fB\-L\fR flag;
omit both flags to set values suitable for a medium-sized file server
machine.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR <\fIstack size\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-k <stack size>"
Sets the \s-1LWP\s0 stack size in units of 1 kilobyte. Do not use this argument,
and in particular do not specify a value less than the default of \f(CW24\fR.
.IP "\fB\-realm\fR <\fIKerberos realm name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-realm <Kerberos realm name>"
Defines the Kerberos realm name for the File Server to use. If this
argument is not provided, it uses the realm name corresponding to the cell
listed in the local \fI/usr/afs/etc/ThisCell\fR file.
.IP "\fB\-udpsize\fR <\fIsize of socket buffer in bytes\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-udpsize <size of socket buffer in bytes>"
Sets the size of the \s-1UDP\s0 buffer, which is 64 \s-1KB\s0 by default. Provide a
positive integer, preferably larger than the default.
.IP "\fB\-enable_peer_stats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-enable_peer_stats"
Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
storage. For each connection with a specific \s-1UDP\s0 port on another machine,
a separate record is kept for each type of \s-1RPC\s0 (FetchFile, GetStatus, and
so on) sent or received. To display or otherwise access the records, use
the Rx Monitoring \s-1API\s0.
.IP "\fB\-enable_process_stats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-enable_process_stats"
Activates the collection of Rx statistics and allocates memory for their
